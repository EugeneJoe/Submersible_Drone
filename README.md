# Submersible Drone Project

The files in this repository describe the different aspects that went into building our submersible, remote controlled drone. The drone was capable of underwater exploration through the use of a camera that sent back a live video feed of the submerged environment.
The different sections that went into the drone are:

1. An outer shell that is water-tight and housed all the components and positioned them appropriately.
2. Three motors from water pumps to provide vertical and horizontal thrust.
3. A raspberry pi controller through which the live video feed was transmitted and
propulsion signals were sent.
4. An arduino controller that received signals from the raspberry pi and drove the motors
through motor controller chips.
5. A raspberry pi camera module to capture video and transmit it back to the user. This could be viewed from a laptop.

The Final Report document contains a detailed report of how we went about designing and building the drone.
